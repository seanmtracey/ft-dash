## FT Dash 
An exploration of applying FT content to your car windscreen.

### Development

This prototype is based on the code from Big FT.

### Running

To run FT Dash

1) Clone this repo
2) run ```npm i``` inside the directory to install the app dependancies (There are quite a few, the Big FT dependencies have yet to be stripped)
3) ```npm run build:app```
4) ```npm start```

You will now be able to access FT Dash from localhost:3000

### First run

When you first view the FT Dash app, you'll be presented with the config view. Place the iPad on the dashboard of your car (or test surface that you've arranged) and move the slider up and down on the screen until rectangle is no longer warped. 

Tap the circle on the opposite side of the screen to save the rotation configuration and show the articles. If the content is off of the screen, you can scale it by moving two fingers up and down the screen.

To adjust the rotation again, tap the screen with 3 fingers and the configuration window will appear again.
